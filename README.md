Purpose: 
This repository contains analysis from RNASeq on total RNA isolated from self-assembling co-cultures of primary human hepatocytes (SACC-PHHs) mono-infected with HBV, co-infected with HBV/HDV, or uninfected at 8 and 28 days post-infection. In addition, output files (such as differential gene expression profiles) are included.
